            <p>
                Devloped a basic version of a buying and selling forum like ebay for my Class 12 Project
                entirely using
                C++ using the concepts of Data Encapsulation(Class), OOPs , Inheritance , file handling. It
                involved
                creating a user account with an encrypted password then listing the products sold and bought by
                the user
                and also maintain other details of the user like cash at hand,personal info,etc.Binary files
                were used
                to store the data.
